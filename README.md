# MRI_Brain_Tumor_Classification_VGG-16
# Introduction
For my first project, I decided to build a classification model for MRI images of brain tumors, using a transfer learning approach with VGG-16.

So as a biologist, I will explain the data a bit ðŸ˜Š

We have 4 classes:

No tumor

Pituitary tumor - this tumor is located in the pituitary gland. The tumor is benign and is caused by abnormal growth of glandular cells pituitary.

Meningioma tumor - most of these tumors are benign and form on membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.

Glioma tumor - this tumor is malignant and occurs in the brain or the spinal cord from the abnormal growth of Glioma cells.

The MRI scans are in grayscale, and the difference between some tumors can be very small, so I think it's a challenge for the model to classify the scans, I hope that by fine-tuning he will success getting good results.

I enjoyed exploring the data and to check how different hyper-parameters influence the model.

I hope that you will enjoy from my project too ðŸ˜Š
